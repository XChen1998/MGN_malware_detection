How To add translations to Quick Forecast
==========================================

The "translations" folder contains QuickForecast TS files.

The available languages are found in the LANGUAGES line of weatherapp.pro.

# Add a new language

1 - Run "make ts-untranslated"
2 - Rename QuickForecast_unstranslated.ts with the expected language
3 - Add your language <lang> to the LANGUAGES line in weatherapp.pro
    (don't qualify it with a country unless you expect country-specific variants)
4 - Open QuickForecast_<lang>.ts in Qt Linguist, set the target language and translate

# Update an existing language

1 - Run "make ts-<lang> to update the specific <lang> TS file
    (Alternatively run "make ts-all" to update TS files for all LANGUAGES)
2 - Open QuickForecast_<lang>.ts in Qt Linguist and translate

# Create a commit

1 - Discard the modifications to any .ts files except yours
2 - Run "make commit-ts" (To keep the changes smaller, the commit-ts target also
    strips out the line number information from the TS files)
3 - If needed, amend the commit with the modified weatherapp.pro file

# QM files
The QM files are automatically generated for the available TS files when running
qmake on weatherapp.pro.
