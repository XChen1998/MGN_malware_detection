# BusyBotNet Unique Tools

In this directory you will find a variety of security tools. We've added a few cryptography tools using mbedtls. There are also
a lot of offsec tools, such as the infamous Xersex (most powerful ddos program). You may notice when compiling that some of
the code is messy. There are also a few broken applets that need help (they're disabled in the included config). Want to help
make busybotnet better? This directory is probably the place to start.
