.SH NAME
pnscan \- multi threaded port scanning tool
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpnscan\fR [ \fBoptions\fR]  [ \fB<CIDR | host-range> <port-range>\fR] 


\fBpnscan\fR [ \fBoptions\fR]  [ \fB<port>\fR] 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the
\fBpnscan\fR command.
.PP
\fBpnscan\fR is a tool that can be used to survey
TCP network services.
.PP
When used with two command line arguments it will scan the indicated
network/hosts and ports. When used without arguments or just one then
it will read hostname/IP addresses from stdin and probe those. The single
port/service argument is used as a default if no port is indicated on stdin
.PP
For example, it can be used to survey the installed versions of
SSH, FTP, SMTP, Web, IDENT and possibly other services.
.PP
This program implements a multithreaded TCP port scanner.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Show summary of options.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Be verbose.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Print version.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Print internal debugging info.
.TP
\fB-s \fR
Lookup and print hostnames. This will slow down the
scan considerably. 
.TP
\fB-S\fR
Enable shutdown mode. With this enabled pnscan will
call shutdown(2) with an argument of 1 in order to half-close
the TCP connection after any -w/-W arguments has been transmitted.
The default is to wait for the remote party to close its end
first (or until enough bytes has been received).
.TP
\fB-l\fR
Line oriented output. This option will cause pnscan to
try to locate the beginning of a line when a match (-r/-R) has
been found, and only print up to the last byte/character on
that line.
.TP
\fB-w<string> \fR
Request string to send. Please note that you must
send any needed CR/LF characters as needed by the protocol
since the string specified is sent as is (after escape
characters has been decoded).
.TP
\fB-r<string> \fR
Response string to look for.
.TP
\fB-W<hex list> \fR
Hex coded request string to send.
.TP
\fB-R<hex list> \fR
Hex coded response string to look for.
.TP
\fB-L<length> \fR
Max bytes of response to print.
.TP
\fB-t<msecs> \fR
Connect/Write/Read timeout.
.TP
\fB-n<workers> \fR
Maximum concurrent worker threads to start.
