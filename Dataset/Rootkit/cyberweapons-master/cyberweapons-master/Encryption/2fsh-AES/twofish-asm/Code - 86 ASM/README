               Optimized ANSI C + 386 Assembler Diskette


Files on this diskette:

File Name           Description
========================================================================

README          This file

PLATFORM.H      Platform-specific definitions (e.g., endianness, rotates)

TABLE.H         Macros and tables for Twofish internal structures

AES.H           AES header file, function prototypes

DEBUG.H         Debug i/o macros and functions

TWOFISH2.C      Optimized ANSI C source code

TST2FISH.C      Test code, links with TWOFISH2.C to generate KAT/MCT

COMPILE.BAT     Batch file used to compile TST2FISH.EXE.  See this file for
                the set of compiler options used to optimize performance.
 
2FISH_86.ASM    Optimized assembly language for Pentium/PentiumPro/PentiumII.

CPUTYPE.ASM     Intel code to detect CPU type.

STRUCMAC.INC    Portable structured programming macros for assembly language.

TST2FISH.EXE    Executable 32-bit console app of TST2FISH.C, TWOFISH2.C,
                and 2FISH_86.ASM linked together.  Use the -a switch to
                run the assembly language version.

========================================================================

Notes:

The program TST2FISH.EXE will generate the full set of KAT/MCT/Tables 
files (excluding the intermediate values file) in the current directory,
if run with the -M switch:
 
	TST2FISH -M -a

When run without command-line parameters, it will generate a partial MCT set,
since the full set takes a long time.

When run with a question mark character ('?') as a parameter, TST2FISH.EXE
will display a help screen of command line options.

The -t switch will time the encryption, decryption, and key schedule setup
routines, down to the clock cycle.  Use it in conjunction with -a to
time both C and assembly language versions.
