Cheat Engine 2.3
Ok, i'm not good at writing help files for my programs, but i'll try.

Whats new since version 2.3


How to use Cheat Engine 2.3:
each time you do a first scan Cheat Engine makes a complete image of the memory
on your hard disk. (Cheat Engine dir), after that it will use that image to
search for values and other stuff.

If you do an ADVANCED search CE also makes an image on your hard disk but wont
continue scanning after making the image. This allows you to start searching
the memory where you dont know the exact value of the item you're trying to
find.

finaly:
