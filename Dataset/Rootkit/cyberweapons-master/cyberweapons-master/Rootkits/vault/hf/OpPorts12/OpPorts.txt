	Open Ports does almost the same as FPort by Foundstone, Inc. but 
contains no code from that program. The main difference is that our Open Ports 
is open source. Second difference is that Open Ports names object via driver.
	This program enumerates the list of all open TCP and UDP ports in the 
system and associates them with their host process.
	Main program is written in Delphi 6, driver in C.
