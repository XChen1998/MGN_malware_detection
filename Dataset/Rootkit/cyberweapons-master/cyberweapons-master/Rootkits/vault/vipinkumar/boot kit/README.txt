2) It patches the kernel at runtime(no files are patched on disk).(basic version has this code removed , so as others could understand it easily).
3) BOOT KIT is PXE-compatible.
4) It can even lead to first ever PXE virus
5)It also enables you to load other root kits if you have physical access(Normally root kits can only be loaded by the administrator)
