		<h3>Submission based classification</h3>
        <p>When you submit one or many files to {{ app_name }}, you are required to provide the classification of the
            files you are submitting. This classification is for the submission itself and will be applied to all files
            in the submission. If the files that you want to submit have a different classification, you should submit
            them one by one and apply the proper classification to each submission.</p>
        <p>If you realize that you've submitted a file with the wrong classification, you can always use the delete
            button in the submission detail page to get rid of the submission.</p>

        <h3>One file, multiple submissions</h3>
        <p>If two submission contain the same file but those submissions have different classifications, the system
        	will assign to lowest classification of the two submissions to the file.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <div class="indent">
            {% raw %}
            <p>Lets assume the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Submission1</strong> is classified <strong class="{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Submission2</strong> is classified <strong class="{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong></li>
                <li><strong>File1</strong> is in all submissions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>File1</strong>'s classification will be <strong class="{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong>.
            	<strong>Submission1</strong>and <strong>Submission2</strong> will remain to their original classification.</p>
            <p><i><strong>If one of the submission is deleted</strong></i>, let's says <strong>Submission2</strong>. The system will
            	re-calculate the classification of all the files related to the deleted submission.
            	<strong>File1</strong>'s classification will now be <strong class="{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong>.
            	<strong>Submission1</strong> will remain to its original classification.</p>
            {% endraw %}
        </div>

		<h3>Service results have classification too!</h3>
		<p>The various {{ app_name }} services will output their results at different classification levels depending on the
        	technique/tool used to provide the result. To prevent the search engine from displaying results of
        	classified files to unclassified users, the system will apply the maximum classification between the
        	file classification and the service result classification to the results.</p>
		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        {% raw %}
        <div class="indent">
            <p>Lets assume the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File1</strong> is classified <strong class="{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong></li>
                <li><strong>ServiceX</strong> results for <strong>File1</strong> are
                    <strong class="{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong></li>
                <li><strong>File2</strong> is <strong class="{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong></li>
                <li><strong>ServiceY</strong> results for <strong>File2</strong> are classified
                    <strong class="{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ServiceX</strong> results for <strong>File1</strong> are going to be classified
                <strong class="{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong> because the file is classified higher then the service
                results. In the eyes of an <strong class="{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.UNRESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong> user, they will not
                exist.</p>
            <p><strong>ServiceY</strong> results for <strong>File2</strong> will remain classified
                <strong class="{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.RESTRICTED | class_long }}</strong> since the classification of the results is higher
            	than the classification of the file itself.</p>
        {% endraw %}
        </div>

		<h3>How is the classification validated?</h3>
        <h4>Classification</h4>
        <p>Classification is validated by using <strong>greater than or equal</strong>. The user's classification has to
            be greater than or equal to submission/file/result he or she is trying to view/search.</p>
        {% raw %}
        <p><strong>Currently Supported classifications:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li ng-repeat="slvl in level_list()"><strong class="{{ slvl | class_text_color }}">{{ classification_definition.levels_map_stl[slvl] }}</strong> :: {{ classification_definition.description[slvl] }}</li>
		</ul>

        <h4>Required tokens</h4>
        <p>To view a piece of information protected with required tokens, the user <strong>must have all</strong> the
            tokens that the submission/file/result the user is trying to view has.
            </p>
        <p><strong>Currently Supported Required Tokens:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li ng-repeat="(sreq, val) in classification_definition.access_req_map_stl"><strong>{{ classification_definition.access_req_map_stl[sreq] }}</strong> :: {{ classification_definition.description[sreq] }}</li>
            <li ng-if="getLength(classification_definition.access_req_map_stl) == 0">No required tokens available</li>
		</ul>

        <h4>Groups Releaseability</h4>
        <p>To view a piece of information protected with a group releaseability, the user <strong>must have at least
            one</strong> of the groups that the submission/file/result the user is trying to view has.</p>
        <p><strong>Currently Supported Groups:</strong></p>
        <ul>
		    <li ng-repeat="(sgrp, val) in classification_definition.groups_map_stl"><strong>{{ classification_definition.groups_map_stl[sgrp] }}</strong> :: {{ classification_definition.description[sgrp] }}</li>
            <li ng-if="getLength(classification_definition.groups_map_stl) == 0">No groups available</li>
		</ul>
        <p class="text-danger"><strong>** NOTE:</strong> not providing a group makes it available to all.</p>

        <h4>Sub-Groups Releaseability</h4>
		<p>To view a piece of information protected with a sub-groups releaseability, the user <strong>must have at least
            one</strong> of the sub-groups that the submission/file/result the user is trying to view has.</p>
		<p><strong>Currently Supported Sub-Groups:</strong></p>
        <ul>

            <li ng-if="getLength(classification_definition.subgroups_map_stl) == 0">No subgroups available</li>
		</ul>
        <p class="text-danger"><strong>** NOTE:</strong> not providing a subgroup makes it available to all.</p>
