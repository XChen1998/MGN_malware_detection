# stealer
Simple keylogger on C++ with several functions. This keylogger hides console, makes screenshots every 50 seconds and adds himself to registry.

Build this project using Microsoft Visual Studio.
Create a new console application. Then copy files from the repository.

Keylogger creates a new folder 'Public' and keeps keylogs and screenshots there. To see results go 'C:\Users\Public\Public'.

Maybe some time later I'll add the ability to send files to server or an email.
