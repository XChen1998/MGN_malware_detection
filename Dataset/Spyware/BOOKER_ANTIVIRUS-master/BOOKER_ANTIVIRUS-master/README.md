# TITLE #

Booker Antivirus is an all new, extensible and highly synergistic platform for multiple and area-wide shock-wave generators. With the ability to destroy all types of worms (not earthworms, like ones on your computer). Unlike most antivirus softwares, which are written in Visual Basic, BA offers an unforgettable experience for the whole family.

## THE MAN BEHIND THE SAUCE ##

Named after the famed superhero, Booker DeWitt; the False Shepard of Columbia and reliever of debt for the whole world, Booker Antivirus brings the same ass-kicking excitement of Booker, with the Class-A malware detection abilities of John McAfee.

# WHY BOOKER?#

After Booker died for our sins in the early 1900s, we thought it was necessary to create antiviral software in his name. Honor his name by using our product.

# WHY OPEN SOURCE? #

In order to maintain maximum agility throughout the development cycle, we've decided to allow the greater community of the Intranet to pull request new features. With our help, we can make Booker Antivirus the best thing since Viagra.exe.

# WHY NOW? #

Why ever? Why are you reading this? Is there really a point to anything? Why do we have consciousness? Do we deserve to exist? Now go to your room/bathroom and think about that over a good smoke/vodka tonic.
