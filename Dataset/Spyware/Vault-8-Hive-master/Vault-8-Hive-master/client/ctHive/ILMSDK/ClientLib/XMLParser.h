/*-----------------  XMLParser - FILE DESCRIPTION  -----------------*

Declaration of the XMLParser class.  This module was shamelessly plagiarized
from the open-source EasySoap project, thought it has been augmented with
some functionality that will make it easier to use as a stand-alone XML
parser, and some of the higher-level namespace management capabilities
have been jettisoned in the interest of simplicity since they were not
needed for the immediate application.

/**
   XMLParser is the base class for extensions that reconstitute an object from
   an XML stream. XMLParser is based on the open-source Expat XML parsing
   library, and is a class wrapper for the most commonly used capabilities of
   that library.  XMLParser allows a much more reasonable distribution of
   parsing intelligence among classes representing complex types within
   an XML stream, rather than having to have one "uber-parser" that
   must be able to interpret an entire XML document.

   XMLParser has no pure virtual methods, and is thus instantiable as is
   (though it won't do much by itself.)  This is a boon to derived classes
   that don't need all of the overrides; for example, many applications
   may not care about the namespace declarations, and would thus not need
   to override the startNamespace and endNamespace methods.

<example>
   There are two ways to use an XMLParser.  The "quick" way is good when you
   have the luxury of waiting until the entire XML stream is available before
   you begin parsing.  This is frequently the case when you're using XMLParser
   as a SOAP-like mechanism for serializing objects.  The long way is better for
   piecemeal work, when you need to start parsing a stream before it's all
   available, or if it's too big to conveniently handle in a single chunk.

   For both approaches, you need to derive a class that extends XMLParser, and
   overrides at least one of its protected virtual methods:

<pre>
   class MyParserClass : public XMLParser
   {
   public:
      double dblVal;
      int    intVal;
   protected:
      string charBuf;

      virtual void endElement (
            const char *name)
      {
         if (strcmp(name, "dblVal")==0) {
            dblVal = atof(charBuf.c_str());
         } else if (strcmp(name, "intVal")==0) {
            intVal = atoi(charBuf.c_str());
         }
      }

      virtual void characterData (
            const char *str, int len)
      {
         charBuf = string(str, (string::size_type)len);
      }
   };
</pre>

   In this case, we've created a class which overrides two of the three common
   data recovery methods in XMLParser.  MyParserClass acts as its own XMLParser,
   and it deserializes its two data members from elements whose XML tag names
   happen to be the same as the member names.  It uses a single string member,
   charBuf, as a temporary holding location to save element contents until we
   know which member to parse them into.  (An alternative solution would have
   been to override startElement instead of endElement, set an enumerated member
   to indicate which if any member's element is being parsed, and interpret the
   data in characterData; either approach is equally valid, since we get the
   same tag name argument in both startElement and endElement methods.)
   MyParserClass will work against an XML fragment that looks like this:

<pre>
   <obj>
     <dblVal>3.14159</dblVal>
     <intVal>42</intVal>
   </obj>
</pre>

   The <obj> tags are ignored by MyParserClass, but are needed to make a valid
   XML document (which must have exactly one root element.)  In practice, it's
   typical for a serialized object not to be responsible for its delimiting
   element tags, but instead to leave them up to a containing object.

   The short approach will simply look like this:

<pre>
   char* xmlText = "<obj> <dblVal>3.14159</dblVal> <intVal>42</intVal> </obj>"
   MyParserClass c;
   c.QuickParse(xmlText);
</pre>

   While QuickParse can be called multiple times with different segments of the
   XML stream, it shines in cases where the whole thing can be done in one shot,
   especially when there's no need to explicitly allocate the memory for it. By
   contrast, the long approach would look something like this:

<pre>
   fstream fs("myStream.xml", ios_base::in);
   MyParserClass prsr;
   prsr.InitParser();

   while (!fs.eof()) {
      char* buffer = (char*)prsr.GetParseBuffer(40);
      fs.getline(buffer, 40, '>');
      int i=strlen(buffer);
      if (!fs.eof() && i!=0) {
         buffer[i]='>';  // Since this is getline delimiter, have to put it back
         if (!prsr.ParseBuffer(i+1)) {
            cout << prsr.GetErrorMessage() << endl;
            break;
         }
      }
   }
</pre>

   While the long approach obviously requires more lines of code, and is going
   to go back to the memory well a number of times for buffer allocation, it
   should be apparent that it's much better at dealing with a continuous stream
   of information.  In our example, we've keyed our getline function off of the
   tag end delimiter, '>', rather than an end-of-line.  This is a good strategy
   for parsing a serialized object that doesn't have any long element text,
   since it's impervious to unbeautified input.  You need only guarantee that
   the specified buffer size is long enough to contain the longest element text
   plus the longest end tag.

   </example>
