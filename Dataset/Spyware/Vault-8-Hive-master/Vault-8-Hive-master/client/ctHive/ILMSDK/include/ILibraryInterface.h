      Defines the common interface for Interface Library Module (ILM) instance
      class wrappers. The surface of this interface parallels the "C"-style
      exported endpoint functions described in JY008C615, CutThroat ICD;
      however, the interface methods are defined at a higher abstraction level.
      This provides a basis for an implementation that separates the low-level
      formatting for CT/ILM data transfer from more intelligent (and easier to
      code) functionality at a higher level of ILM functionality.
      
      <see cref="LibraryModuleBase"/> provides an
      implementation of ILibraryInterface.
