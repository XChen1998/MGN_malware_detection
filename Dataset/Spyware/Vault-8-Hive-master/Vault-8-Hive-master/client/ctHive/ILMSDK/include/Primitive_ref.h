      This class provides the means to pass information between Primitive
      Activation instances for common commands that require more than one
      command primitive.  CutThroat is not able to repeat the same argument
      across multiple primitives (it's always associated with the first
      primitive in a command sequence), and it's also possible that some
      commands will require the results of a prior primitive as an argument.  To
      resolve both of these problems, a ProcessCmdAccumulator is used to hold
      string representations of named values that are passed along through a
      series of primitive handler functions (see HandlerFcnPtr in this module).
      
      The keys used in a ProcessCmdAccumulator and the associated values
      required by various primitive handler functions are specific to the ILM
      implementation.  However, it is recommended that where practical, keys
      are used which match the argument names appearing in JY008C616 through
      'C630, the Primitive Family inteface descriptions.
