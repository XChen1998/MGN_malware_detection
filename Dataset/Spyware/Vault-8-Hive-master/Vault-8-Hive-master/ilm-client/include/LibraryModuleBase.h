   /**
      The base class for the implementation of an Interface Library Module (ILM).
      As an ILibraryInterface inheritor, LibraryModuleBase provides a class wrapper
      for the interface endpoints, with virtual handler methods that are matched
      1-for-1 with those exported functions.  In addition, it provides XML parsing
      and generation services, with more intelligent overloads for the interface
      service functions that will speed the development of ILMs.

      An ILM will create a single instance of a LibraryModuleBase-derived class,
      and this object will automatically become the target for the C-declared
      exported interface endpoints. (The LibraryModuleBase constructor will set
      the handlerObject member to point to the first created instance, and the
      endpoint functions have access to this pointer to invoke the overridden
      member functions.)
   */

      *  implementation loads the callback endpoints from the calling

         An inheriting class can override this method to perform any
         implementation-specific initialization tasks associated with the
         establishment of a control post connection.  If this is done, the
         implementation should call the base class' Initialize first, and then
         proceed with its own actions, for example:  <pre>
       
         class MyILM : public LibraryModuleBase {
      *     virtual String InitializeExt() {
      *        String returnVal = LibraryModuleBase::InitializeExt();

               // If you encounter any errors, append the message(s) to returnVal
               return returnVal;
            }
            ...
         };

       <returns>
          A null string if initialization was successful.  Otherwise, a
          human-readable error message appropriate for the operator of the
          connecting application is returned.
