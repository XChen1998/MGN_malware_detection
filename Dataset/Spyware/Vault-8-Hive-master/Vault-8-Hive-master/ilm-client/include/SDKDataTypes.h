/*-----------------  SDKDataTypes - FILE DESCRIPTION  -----------------*

Declaration of the basic components that appear in the ILM interface.

Author's note (9/4/07): The proliferation of known-length integer types
continues with the addition of the int16/uint16 types.  For the sake of
completeness, the #if directive testing the size of the native int type has been
inserted as an option; however, at the time of writing, it seems extremely
unlikely that any piece of this application will ever see a 16-bit processor.
The real issue is what happens in the other direction: should the compilation
environment change such that the native int type is 64 bits in length, we'll be
screwed, because we'll need two known-length integer types (int16 & int32) and
will have only one standard type (short) available to cover them.  So, here's
hoping that the C/C++ standards committees finally see reason and fix the native
type length issue before this problem rears its head.
