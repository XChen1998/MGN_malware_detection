/*-----------------  XMLComposer - FILE DESCRIPTION  -----------------*

Declaration of the XMLComposer class.  This module was shamelessly plagiarized
from the open-source EasySoap project, thought it has been augmented with
some functionality that will make it easier to use as a stand-alone XML
generator, and some of the higher-level namespace management capabilities
have been jettisoned in the interest of simplicity since they were not
needed for the immediate application.

/**
An instance of the XMLComposer class can be used as the basis for serializing objects as
XML streams.  Creating XML is not terribly difficult; far less so in fact than
parsing it.  However, to do so in a manner that follows good Object-Oriented
design principals, where the knowledge of how to serialize an object lies in the
object's class or a designated proxy, one can readily benefit from some
assistance in maintaining the syntax of XML and the state of the XML stream
heirarchy.  It is exactly this gap which XMLComposer is intended to fill.

<h3>Example</h3>

Let's assume two classes, one of which contains a collection of the other, and
both of which have a method that makes good use of an XMLComposer:
<pre>

class A {
private:
   int intMember;
   std::string strMember;
public:
   A(int i, const char* s) : intMember(i), strMember(s) {} // Initializing constructor

   XMLComposer& XMLCompose(XMLComposer& c) {
      c.WriteSimpleElement("intMember", intMember);
      c.WriteSimpleElement("strMember", strMember.c_str());
      return c;
   }
   ...
}

class B {
public:
   double dblMember;
   std::vector&lt;A&gt;   objects;
   XMLComposer& XMLCompose(XMLComposer& c) {
      c.StartTag("Class_B");
      c.WriteSimpleElement("dblMember", dblMember);
      for (int i=0; i<object.length(); i++) {
         c.StartTag("Class_A");
         objects[i].XMLCompose(c);
         c.EndTag();
      }
      c.EndTag();
      return c;
   }
   ...
}

</pre>
Since the data members of class A are private, we really can't do without
something like the XMLCompose method if an object of that type is going to be
serialized as XML, or as anything else for that matter.  The code fragment
<pre>

B  bObj;
bObj.dblMember = -3.14159;
bObj.objects[0] = A(6, "blah blah blah");
bObj.objects[1] = A(3, "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious");

XMLComposer c;
c.beautify = true;
c.Reset(true);
c.StartTag("rootElement");
c.AddAttr("minorTweak", "true");
bObj.XMLCompose(c);
c.StartTag("part2");
c.AddAttr("name", "NakedAObject");
A(83, "Wikipedia is cool.").XMLCompose(c);
c.EndTag();
c.EndTag();
clog << c.GetBytes().c_str();

</pre>
produces the following output in the standard log:
\verbatim

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rootElement minorTweak=true>
  <Class_B>
    <dblMember>-3.14159</dblMember>
    <Class_A>
      <intMember>6</intMember>
      <strMember>blah blah blah</strMember>
    </Class_A>
    <Class_A>
      <intMember>3</intMember>
      <strMember>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</strMember>
    </Class_A>
  </Class_B>
  <part2 name=NakedAObject>
    <intMember>83</intMember>
    <strMember>Wikipedia is cool.</strMember>
  </part2>
</rootElement>

\endverbatim
Note that regardless of the nesting level of an A object, its rendering always
obeys correct XML syntax.  Also see that for data types that can be inserted
into an ostream, such as B's dblMember, XMLComposer's inheritance from
stringstream supplies all that's needed to format those types.

One thing you may notice if you look at the example in detail is that A's
XMLCompose method was not responsible for writing the object's own XML entity
tag.  This is because in actual practice, especially in the case of a container
object like B, the tag may need to be varied in order to assure the ability to
uniquely identify the run-time type.  Also, when XML is being parsed, a class
like A will probably not be given control until <i>after</i> its element start
tag has been detected; thus, to preserve the symmetry of the operations,
composition of the start tag has also been "bumped up" to the containing
functions.


<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>

EasySoap's original XMLComposer didn't inherit from anything, and did its own
manual buffer management and all of that.  To provide a bit of extra functionality
for free, and to simplify the code, this author elected instead to base the
class on a stringstream, providing an insertion operator as well as all sorts of
handy buffer access functions.  It also seemed superfluous (and even a little
error-prone) to have the EndTag method require the tag name as a parameter; the
class should be smart enough to remember this information, and now it is.
