[ RatHole 1.2 ]

About
-----
RatHole is a unix backdoor which compiles cleanly on standard linux and
openbsd (probably other bsd flavours also) without addicional libraries. 
It features blowfish encryption, process name hiding and definition of a
prefered shell. When a client connects to the backdoor a new shell process
and two pipe files are created. The I/O of the shell is duped to the pipes
and the daemon encrypts the communication.


Install
-------
There's a makefile to build it. Just type 'make'. You'll get two files:
'rat' and 'hole'. The hole is the backdoor and the rat is the client. If
you prefer to transfer a single source file into your newly compromised
server, merge the contents of blowfish.c + hole.c and compile it by hand.
Don't forget to set your own #defines, like the port and password, on
hole.c! By the way, if you fail to enter the correct password shit will
fly and unexpected evil things might fall upon you. Also rename the hole
file and use the same name as your fake process.


Credits
-------
The blowfish code was riped from icmpchat. Everything else was coded
during a cold winter afternoon back in 2004. This is work in progress.
You're free to rip it apart and fuck it sideways.
