# PHP Backdoor
PHP module based backdoor to intercept standard-library & module function calls. For a full explanation of what this is, why it was made and how it works, please refer to my blog post [Your interpreter isn’t safe anymore — The PHP module rootkit](https://blog.paradoxis.nl/your-interpreter-isnt-safe-anymore-the-php-module-rootkit-c7ca6a1a9af5).


## Compilation
To prevent malicious script kiddies from getting their hands on a weaponized PHP module, I've removed the compilation instructions alongside the implementation of the method hooks. 

Furthermore, I will not be releasing pre-compiled binaries. Any semi-experienced C developer should be able to find out how to compile PHP modules and implement the the `rootkit_hook_function` 
method.

Issues created regarding this will not be addressed and closed.
