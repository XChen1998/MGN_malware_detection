# Welcome to JAVA World

## Description
* This is an awesome program that automatically generate mini source code. I made this program because I can not trust my eyes and fingers. Actually, I know many of you don't like JAVA, but try it! It will be not worse than you thought. JAVA is gooood.

* This program only supports **puts**, **gets**, **strcmp**, **exit** functions.
* [../login/login.mini](../login/login.mini) is generated by this program.
* If you want to use this program, please forks this repository. I love forking!

## How to use
```
$ javac generateMini.java
$ java generateMini [input file] > [result file]
```

## Example
### C Source Code
 
```c
void main ( void )
{
  char * buf = malloc ( /* some amount */ );
  printf ( " User : " );
  gets ( buf );
  
  if ( strcmp ( buf , " user " ) == 0 )
  {
    printf ( " Password : " );
    gets ( buf );
    
    if ( strcmp ( buf , " password " ) == 0 )
      puts ( " Success " );
    else
      puts ( " Failure " );
  }
  else     
    puts ( " Failure " );
 
  exit ( 0 );
}
```

### Input File (Semantically equivalent to the above C code)
```
puts("User: ")
gets(buf)
strcmp(buf,"user",4,9)
puts("Password: ")
gets(buf)
strcmp(buf,"password",7,9)
puts("Success")
exit
puts("Failure")
exit
```
