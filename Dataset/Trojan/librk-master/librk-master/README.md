#libRK <- librootkit

Some helper functions that make the writing of warez a bit easier


##Ideas:

HTTP_Send(int sock, void *buf, size_t bytes_to_send);

GPG_file_send(FILE* file, char* key, int socket);

sepuku() <- mangle source elf before unlink? IDK Maybe

Also: Win32-Win64 everything!!!

I got (and fixed up) SSL_server from the openssl wiki.
get_socket is something I wrote by myself... I think....
gdb_check is taken from a StackOverflow answer.
all 8 LoC of sepuku is entirely my work!!!
